title: First Week in Metis
---

  As I begin my second week in Metis, I look back at week 1 and understand now how intense these coming weeks will be. I am only two and half years removed from college but I can already tell that I'll be tested by this bootcamp in ways I never was before and despite the feeling of imposter syndrome already creeping in, I know that there are many others in my cohort that are facing the same challenges. I understand and appreciate my strengths and weaknesses and am willing and able to push myself to the maximum of my ability.
  
  I feel that it is beneficial to recap what we've done this week in order to visualize the progress that I've made:

* Github introduction and how to use it daily
* Intro to Pandas + technical intro to how Pandas processes data
  - ex. Groupby - splits, applies, and combines
* A brief intro to Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Project Benson - group project
* Deep vs. Shallow Copying   
 
 Onto Week 2!
